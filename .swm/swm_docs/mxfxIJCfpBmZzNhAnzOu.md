This playlist is a part of the Secure Coding repository, created to help you improve your secure coding skills.

It consists of walkthroughs, as well as hands-on Units covering best practices and explanations.

The playlist aims to provide you with **practical tools** that are used in the industry, as well as **general knowledge** and also **intuition** regarding secure coding practices.

Some of the Units also contain links to additional resources where you can find out more.

# Required Knowledge
We assume basic Python knowledge.

# Setup
* Have `python3` in your path launch Python 3. That is, you should be able to launch `python3` from the terminal.
* Install the requirements for this playlist - using `pip install -r python/requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r python/requirements.txt`

Before you take your first few steps it's important to set our expectations:

# Hands-on Units
Sometimes you will have walkthroughs to read through, and sometimes - hands-on Units to solve. In this case you will be asked to make some tests pass (use `swimm test` as a shortcut for that) and will be presented with the files necessary for you to edit after you `swimm play`.
