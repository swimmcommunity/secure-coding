A lot of our applications are actually comprised of third party components. Using components with known vulnerabilities is a widespread problem in application development - if you rely on a vulnerable component, your app is vulnerable as well.

As mentioned in [OWASP's page](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check):

> The problem with using known vulnerable components was described very well in a paper by Jeff Williams and Arshan Dabirsiaghi titled, “Unfortunate Reality of Insecure Libraries”. The gist of the paper is that we as a development community include third party libraries in our applications that contain well known published vulnerabilities (such as those at the National Vulnerability Database).
