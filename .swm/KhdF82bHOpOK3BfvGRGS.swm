Most of the Units will be relevant for any web framework, but some will be specific to Flask.\n\nEven if you are not acquainted with Flask, we are sure you can gain a lot from this playlist.\n\n# What is Flask?\n> Flask is a lightweight [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around [Werkzeug](https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug) and [Jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja) and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks. ([Source](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/))\n\n# A small Flask app\nLook how easy it is to create a web app with Flask:\n```\nfrom flask import Flask, escape, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    name = request.args.get(\"name\", \"World\")\n    return f'Hello, {escape(name)}!'\n```\n\n# Make sure you can run our Flask server\nIn the upcoming Units we will use a Flask server.\n\nMake sure you have `Flask` installed:\n\n`pip3 install Flask`\n\nThen run:\n\n`python3 ./python/server.py`\n\nNext, open your browser, and browse to:\n`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`\n\nYou should be able to see this greeting message:\n\n![image.png](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/swimmio-content/o/repositories%2FqCAjeLJBCFTjhwWoTpZo%2Fimg%2F0ee3e027-509c-4799-a5c7-4b673cc9401a.png?alt=media&token=17ca4acc-acc4-40b0-8f0d-a97bdd36f2d7)\n\n# Hands-on Units\nSometimes you will have walkthroughs to read through, and sometimes - hands-on Units to solve. In this case you will be asked to make some tests pass (use `swimm test` as a shortcut for that) and will be presented with the files necessary for you to edit after you `swimm play`."
