Most importantly, it scales well - it can run quickly on lots of source code files, and if one researcher is able to sign a known vulnerability - you will also be prompted if it appears in your code.\nAlso, these tools' output is designed for developers â€“ it usually highlights the precise affected location and even provides suggestions.\n\n# Additional References\n* [OWASP - Source Code Analysis Tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools)\n* [OWASP - Static Code Analysis](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Static_Code_Analysis)"
