As a result, if two users have the same password, they'll have the same password hashes - even on different services, as long as the services use the same hashing mechanism.\n\nTherefore, simply using a hash to store the passwords on our services is not enough.\n\nTo prevent the use of lookup tables - we need to randomize each hash. In this case, even when the same password is hashed twice, the hashes are not the same. This will make lookup tables irrelevant for attackers.\n\n# Salt\n(The explanation below is taken from [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm)).\n\n![image.png](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/swimmio-content/o/repositories%2FqCAjeLJBCFTjhwWoTpZo%2Fimg%2F17cdd4df-6fe4-4aaa-900a-57a00e67ccab.png?alt=media&token=5aaf97f2-32e2-4c9b-b7f7-efde71feaaad)\n\nWe can randomize the hashes by appending or prepending a random string, called a salt, to the password before hashing. As shown in the example above, this makes the same password hash into a completely different string every time. To check if a password is correct, we need the salt, so it is usually stored in the user account database along with the hash, or as part of the hash string itself.\n\nThe salt does not need to be secret. Just by randomizing the hashes - lookup tables (and [rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table)) become ineffective. An attacker won't know in advance what the salt will be, so they can't pre-compute a lookup table or rainbow table.\n\n# Additional References\n* https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm\n* [Salt - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography))"
